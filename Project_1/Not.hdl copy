/**
 * Not gate:
 * out = not in
 */

 /* EXPLANTATION OF METHOD:
 constructed from one two input primitive NAND gate
 if the two inputs are connected together, then the case on the
 nand truth table where we have two different high/low inputs doesn't matter
 leaving us with

 x y  NAND(x,y)
 0 0   1
 1 1   0

 but since x = y the truth table can be written as

 x x NAND(x,x)
 0 0   1
 1 1   0

 This is logically equivalent to a NOT gate:
 x NOT(x)
 0   1
 1   0    */



CHIP Not {
    IN in; // defining input and output ports
    OUT out;

    PARTS: // structurally model the logic gate
    // nand gate is already defined, has input pins a, b and output pin out
    // set a, b = to this chips input pin in 
    Nand(a = in, b = in, out = out);
